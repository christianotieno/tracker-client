# Schedule Tracker

## About the project

This project involved creating a tracking App in which a user is presented with a list of things to be measured.
For the Front End, I used React and Ruby on Rails for the Back-End API.

### Build Dependencies üöß

***The only dependencies are NodeJS & yarn. Any NodeJS LTS version will work. Clone this repo and run npm install.***

- To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

### Setup and installation

```
git@github.com:christianotieno/tracker-client.git
```

### Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

### Run the app in the development mode

```
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Run linter checks

```
npx eslint .
```

### Deployment

```
yarn build
```

The command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build's minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
